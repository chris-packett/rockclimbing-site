        <p>
            Indoor rockclimbing is always the best place to start when you are first learning the skill.
            When you first go to an indoor rockclimbing gym, you are given a warm welcome by the community that
            calls it their second home. It is a non-judgemental environment to learn. The first thing that I did 
            when I first went to an indoor rockclimbing gym, was learning how to top rope. Top roping is fun because
            it lets you climb higher than when you boulder, while still feeling completely safe like using an autobelay.
            In my opinion, top roping is the most stress-relieving activity you can do at an indoor gym!

            Outdoor rockclimbing is for people that have had at least some experience climbing indoors.
            Outdoor climibing is most likely one of the most thrilling things you can do in your life, simply
            because it allows you to go to crazy heights while still being able to fall a considerable amount. 
            This gives you an amazing adrenaline rush. I recommend learning how to lead climb in an indoor gym
            before deciding to go outside to climb. Go back to my <a href="/index.html">home page</a>
            to find out where you can climb outside!
